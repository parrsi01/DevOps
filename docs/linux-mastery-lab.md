# Linux Mastery Lab Notes

Topics covered in this workspace path for repeat practice:

- File permissions
- Users and groups
- Process management
- `systemctl` and `journalctl`
- Networking commands and `ufw`
- Cron jobs
- Disk and memory inspection
- TCP/UDP port inspection

Use a throwaway Ubuntu VM. Keep a snapshot before firewall/disk labs.

Suggested repeat loop:

1. Create the symptom (intentional break).
2. Capture evidence (`systemctl status`, `journalctl`, `ss`, `df`, `free`).
3. Fix one thing at a time.
4. Write a short incident note.
