This folder is a section-by-section command guide for the DevOps labs.

It is written for GitHub iPhone reading: short sections, no wide tables, numbered steps, and full terminal commands.

## What DevOps Is (Plain Language)

DevOps is a software engineering discipline focused on how software is built, released, operated, observed, and improved safely.

It is not one tool. It is a mix of:

- software engineering (automation, code quality, tests)
- systems engineering (Linux, networking, runtime behavior)
- platform engineering (Kubernetes, deployment platforms)
- release engineering (CI/CD, GitOps)
- reliability engineering (monitoring, SLOs, incidents)
- security engineering in delivery pipelines (DevSecOps)

If application engineering builds product features, DevOps builds and operates the delivery + runtime system that keeps those features shipping and working.

## How To Use On GitHub iPhone

1. Open one section file only.
2. Read the `Definitions` and `Theme` first.
3. Run Step 1-5 in a terminal exactly as written.
4. Record what changed after each step.
5. Use the `Done Check` before moving to the next section.

## Parity Goal (Compared With `datascience` Repo)

This folder intentionally mirrors the same learning style used in the Data Science repo:

- numbered sequence
- badges at the top
- mobile-friendly markdown layout
- definitions + concepts + themes
- explicit step-by-step execution flow
- evidence / done checks
